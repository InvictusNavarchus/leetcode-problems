Looks simple at first. I could just convert it to string and check for palindrome the traditional way? But then, why is the input number? Just to be converted to strings? 

Nvm. I just checked the instruction. There is challenge to solve it without converting it to string. I suspect it may relates to some bitwise or binary operation. Yeah I'm sucks at that. Let's just use the string way.
